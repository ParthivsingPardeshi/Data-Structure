# Data Structure Programs

This folder contains various C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental data structure concepts and algorithms. Each program is designed to help understand and implement different data structures and sorting/searching techniques.

## List of Programs

1. **selection_short.cpp**: Implements the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an array.
2. **Stack.cpp**: Demonstrates stack operations (push, pop, display) using an array.
3. **Queue.cpp**: Demonstrates queue operations (insert, delete, display) using an array.
4. **Materix.cpp**: Handles basic matrix input and displays its elements.
5. **Materix_Mult.cpp**: Performs matrix multiplication and displays the resulting matrix.
6. **Insertion_short.cpp**: Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array.
7. **infix_to_post.cpp**: Converts an infix expression to postfix notation using a stack.
8. **Bubble.cpp**: Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array.
9. **Binary_Search.cpp**: Implements the Binary Search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.
10. **Du-Linked-List.cpp**: Demonstrates operations (create, insert, delete, search, display) on a doubly linked list.
11. **Linear_Search.cpp**: Implements the Linear Search algorithm to find an element in an array.
12. **linear_linklist.cpp**: Demonstrates operations (insert, delete, display) on a singly linked list.
13. **Dqueue.cpp**: Implements a deque (double-ended queue) with operations to insert and delete from both ends.

## How to Run

1. Open the program file in a C++ IDE or text editor.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
3. Run the compiled executable and follow the instructions provided in the program.

## Purpose

These programs are part of the coursework for understanding and implementing data structures and algorithms in C++. They are designed to provide hands-on experience with:
- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms
- Stack and queue operations
- Matrix operations
- Expression conversion
- Linked list operations
- Deque operations

Feel free to explore and modify the programs to enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
